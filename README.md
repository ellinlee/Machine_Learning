EDA SWA Group 1

Project Description

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the SWA group, aimed at analyzing various data sources and identifying patterns and anomalies. The project consists of data cleaning, anomaly detection, and visualization to gain insights into the given datasets.

Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

GW_Dachgeschoss: Introduction to the dataset.

Part 1: Fill the Missing Values: Handling missing data points.

Part 2: Fix the Anomalies: Identifying and fixing data anomalies.

Confirmation: Verifying data integrity.

Dataframes: Examination of specific data sections:

df_gw_grafitti_raum

df_gw_stuetzstreben

df_raum_wasserspiele

df_vorraum_wasserspiele

df_kw_modellraum_2_og

df_personenzaehlung_haupteingang

df_kw_bassin_raum

Aussenluft: Analyzing external air data.

Anomaly Identification and Correction: Steps to detect and correct anomalies.

Datetime Conversion and Synchronization: Processing timestamps.

Visualization: Presenting insights through graphs and charts.

Data Processing Steps

Missing values are handled through appropriate imputation methods.

Anomalies are detected and corrected, especially where data deviates significantly from expected ranges.

Synchronization of time-based data for consistency.

Visualization

The notebook includes various plots to visualize the data, focusing on trends, distributions, and anomaly detection.
